<p>Ruet’s teacher is the legendary Pierre-Noel Giraud, who has written of the world being divided into “settlers” and “globalists”. Giraud believes that the outcomes of the 21st century will depend on how these two groups adjust to each other.</p>
<p>The concept of social cooperatives builds on the idea of communities creating infrastructure by using local material and family labour. These can be the village tank, paving the village road — with or without MGNREGA — finishing the last-mile construction of a canal network or even keeping watch on the contractor.</p>
