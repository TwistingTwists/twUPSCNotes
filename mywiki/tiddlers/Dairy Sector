<p>## dairy sector&nbsp;<br />
largest milk producer + small farmers produce 52% surplus (2-4 animals) { ES2018-19 } + Budget2020 double production by 2025</p>
<p><br />
Diary is a part of farming system, not a standalone enterprise.</p>
<p>38% in GVA of Agri 2018</p>
<h3>Focus areas of diary investment:&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Milk processing infra (value added products, like skimmed milk powder) + cold chain infra + chilling milk while harvesting (BRICS young innovator award for this <a href="https://dst.gov.in/affordable-milk-chilling-technology-point-harvest-can-benefit-cattle-farmers">product</a>)</p>
<h3><br />
Significance in Diary sector:&nbsp;</h3>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;WOMEN EMPOWER &nbsp;= 69% of all labor in livestock management - women&nbsp;</li>
<li>Only 20% of milk gets processed through organised sector</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two front intervention -&nbsp; (1) Making globally competitive and (2) increasing demand to match supplies<br />
(1) Productivity of milch animals 2.8L per day is far below the global standards of 20 L per day, Artifical insemination, cross breeding</p>
<p>(2) Expanding demand of milk by introducing it in MDM</p>
<h3><br />
issues&nbsp;</h3>
<p><br />
1. senstive to income -&nbsp;Poor families consume more cereals less milk and protein, Nutrition security<br />
2. no MSP + fat-based pricing (cooperatives) =&gt; 20% less price than open market<br />
3. manpower &nbsp;= Dept of Animal Husbandry = 2L artificial insemination technician needed, 1L vacant&nbsp;<br />
4. adulteration in market&nbsp;</p>
<p>#### steps taken<br />
1. DIDF fund + KCC for DIary farmers (atmanirbhar bharat)</p>
<p>way forward = vet services regular + FEED + value addition to milk (traditional milk)<br />
CLimate resilience of income of indian farmer.</p>
