<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Segoe UI Historic&quot;">India has recently hosted the second mini-ministerial meet of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). It was a kind of preparatory meeting to set a common agenda at the 12th Ministerial Conference, scheduled for June 2020 at Astana, Kazakhstan.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Segoe UI Historic&quot;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Segoe UI Historic&quot;">The 11th Ministerial Conference (Buenos Aires, December 2017) collapsed despite efforts by 164 WTO members to evolve a consensus on several issues. In this regard, this miniministerial meet in New Delhi assumed significance since it enabled members to negotiate all such issues in a convergent manner.</span></span></p>

	<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Segoe UI Historic&quot;">• The WTO agreements contain special provisions which give developing countries special rights and allow other members to treat them more favourably. These are “<strong>special and differential treatment provisions</strong>”.</span></span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Segoe UI Historic&quot;">The special provisions <strong>include longer time periods for implementing agreements and commitments, support to help developing countries to build the infrastructure to undertake WTO work etc</strong>.</span></span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Segoe UI Historic&quot;">Further, it also enables the developing countries to provide higher subsidies as compared to developed countries as seen under the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA)</span></span></p>

	<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Segoe UI Historic&quot;">à <strong>Multilateral Agreement</strong> It is an agreement under the WTO which is adopted through consensus among all the member countries. The provisions of the multilateral agreements are <strong><em>applicable to all the member countries.</em></strong> Further, such agreements may decide to incorporate <strong>special and differential treatment</strong> for the benefit of poor and developing economies. Most of the WTO agreements such as AoA, GATS, TRIPS etc. are multilateral agreements which the member countries are obliged to follow.</span></span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Segoe UI Historic&quot;">à <strong>Plurilateral agreement</strong> It is an agreement between limited number of WTO member countries wherein the countries would be given the choice to agree to new rules on a voluntary basis. In other words, the provisions of plurilateral agreement would not be applicable to all the member countries.</span></span></p>
	<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Segoe UI Historic&quot;">Examples of Plurilateral agreements under WTO include Trade in civil aircraft; Government Procurement; Bovine meat; Dairy products.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">IMPLICATIONS AND CONCERN</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">• The body can become defunct in absence of required members and consequently, countries locked in international trade disputes will be left with no forum for recourse. • India has so far been a direct participant in 54 disputes, and has been involved in 158 as a third party. Further, in February 2019, the appellate body said it would be unable to staff an appeal in a dispute between Japan and India. • This was over certain safeguard measures that India had imposed on imports of iron and steel products. The panel had found that India had acted “inconsistently” with some WTO agreements. • India had notified the Dispute Settlement Body of its decision to appeal certain issues of law and legal interpretations. But it has so far been unable to review at least 10 appeals that have been filed since July 2018. • The larger concern with the issue is that if the body is declared non-functional, countries may be compelled to implement rulings by the panel despite concerns with it. • If a country refuses to comply with the panel's order, it will run the risk of facing arbitration proceedings initiated by the other party. • This does not bode well for India which is facing a rising number of dispute cases, especially on agricultural products.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">Also, the overall weakening of WTO framework could have the effect of undoing over two decades of efforts to avoid protectionism in global trade. • This is a major concern currently, because trade tensions such as between the US and China and the US and India, are on the rise. WAY FORWARD • New appointments to the Appellate Body are usually made by a consensus of WTO members. • But there is also a provision for voting where a consensus is not possible. • The group of 17 least developed and developing countries have committed to working together to end the current impasse. • This group, which includes India, can submit or support a proposal to the above effect, helping to get new members on the Appellate Body by a majority vote.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">OTHER ISSUES UNDER WTO NEGOTIATIONS</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">&nbsp;1. Plurilateral Vs Multilateral agreements:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">• Since the multilateral agreements are consensus driven, normally the trade negotiations under multilateral framework tend to be slow paced and lead to unnecessary delay. However, the good aspect about the multilateral agreements is that they take into account the special needs and interests of poor and developing countries. • In this regard, the debate has arisen between the developed and developing countries with respect to the nature of trade negotiations under the WTO. • The developed countries have put forward four plurilateral agreements in the areas of e-commerce, investment facilitation, MSME and gender. However, developing countries led by India have staunchly opposed the plurilateral agreement and instead pushed forward for the continuation of multilateral framework under WTO.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">2. Agreement of fishery subsidy</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">• The WTO member countries are presently negotiating a multilateral treaty of Fishery Subsidies. This agreement seeks to prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing. • Some of the developed countries such as USA have been insisting that larger developing countries like India and China should not continue to get special and differential treatment. • However, India has argued that special and differential treatment should be built into the fisheries subsidies agreement.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">March 2021<span style="color:#2ecc71">: WTO should not review overfishing, IUU&nbsp;claims in EEZ (protect sovereignty of the member state) - Indian &nbsp;statement</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">3. Agreement on E-Commerce</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">• The developed countries led by USA have been pushing forward for a comprehensive agreement on E-Commerce under the ambit of WTO. • As part of this agreement, the developed countries have put forward a number of proposals which include tackling addressing barriers that prevent cross-border sales; forced data localization requirements and permanently banning customs duties on electronic transmissions, among others. • India has clearly stated that it is against any binding rules in e-commerce.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Avenir Next LT Pro&quot;">4. Permanent solution to public stock holding • India has been demanding a permanent solution on Public National Food stockholding in order to implement Security Act. At the Bali ministerial conference in December 2013, India secured a “peace clause". • Under it, if India breaches the 10% limit on subsidy under AoA, other member countries will not take legal action under the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. Further, in 2014, India forced developed countries to clarify that the peace clause will continue indefinitely until a permanent solution is found</span></span></p>
