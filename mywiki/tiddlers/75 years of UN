<ul>
<li>Setbacks of UN today
<ul>
<li>The institution has been designed to privilege the most powerful states of post-WW II - Undemocratic instruments of veto power and permanent seats in UNSC.</li>
<li>Not represent the present power dynamics.</li>
<li>Risk of War has not gone away – both violence, arms race and war have continued to happen.</li>
<li>Security environment has deteriorated.</li>
<li>Efforts for peace has met massive setback.</li>
<li>Inequality is growing</li>
<li>Issue of Climate change and biodiversity</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Way forward-
<ul>
<li><strong>Multilateralism</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>UNSC must be expanded</strong> in terms of its permanent members- Add India</li>
<li>De-emphasize power; More emphasis on the principles <strong>(Principles &gt; Power)</strong></li></ul></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus there is the need for complete reforms because <strong>UN is about global governance and not about global government</strong>, which gives everybody a certain amount of stakes and allows those who have greater capabilities to be able to take things forward for the benefit of everyone.</li></ul>
