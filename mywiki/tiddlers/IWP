<p>Irrigation water productivity (IWP)&nbsp;vs land productivity. - ES2020&nbsp;</p>
<p>80% of freshwater is used in agri, (60% is GW)</p>
<h3>Need for WUE (water use efficiency) in agri&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
<li>solar pump leading to indiscriminate use, water logging, regional imbalance in rainfall,&nbsp; sub-optimal cropping pattern.</li></ul>
<h3>Irrigation&nbsp;potential created (IPC) vs Irrigated potential used (IPU)</h3>
<p>currently, 52% agri is rainfed =&gt; IPU is low.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>todo</p>
<ul>
<li>less water guzzling crops</li>
<li>use treated waste water of agri</li>
<li>TECHNOLOGY : cost effective water sensor to measure soil moisture to control flooding irrigation, automated sensor to make time table for irrigation.</li>
<li>SCHEMES - PMKSY + MIF (micro irrigation fund NABARD)</li></ul>

<ol>
<li>WUE upto 85-90 %&nbsp; -&gt; agri productivity up by WUE + DFI (+50% income )</li>
<li>soil erosion + water logging + salinity = no</li></ol>
