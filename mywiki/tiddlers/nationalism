	<td>&nbsp;“Nationality is a social feeling. It is a feeling of a corporate sentiment of oneness which makes<br />
	those who are charged with it feel that they are kith and kin. This national feeling is a double-edged feeling. It is at once a<br />
	feeling of fellowship of one’s own kith and kin and an anti-fellowship feeling for those who are not one’s own kith and kin.<br />
	It is a feeling of ‘consciousness of kind’ which on the one hand binds together those who have it so strongly that it<br />
	overrides all difference arising out of economic conflicts or social gradations and, on the other, severs them from those<br />
	who are not of their kind. It is a longing not to belong to any other group. This is the essence of what is called a nationality<br />
	and national feeling.”</td>

	<td>achieve nationalism how?</td>
	<td>This elevated notion of nationality cannot be generated and achieved by mere sloganeering based on a violent masculinist<br />
	approach. It requires a concerted democratic effort and high level of statesmanship and vision to empower people and<br />
	reclaim their dignity through the spread of education and provision of livelihood emanating from an inclusive and non-<br />
	alienating economy as a right. This is the true meaning of Ambedkar’s nationalism, which is creative, compassionate and<br />
	emancipatory in the universalistic sense</td>
