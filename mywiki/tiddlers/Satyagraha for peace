<h3>difference between passive resistance and satyagraha.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Satyagrahais a more dynamic force than passive resistance because it contemplates prolonged mass action in resistance to injustice. Secondly, satyagraha can be practised at all levels-domestic, national and international, while passive resistance is contemplated at a political level only. Thirdly, satyagraha offers continuous purification of mind. It has no place for hatred, while passive resistance may be compatible with internal violence towards the enemy.</p>

<p>Gandhi's world view is rooted in his concept of peace, which was comprehensive. It was neither mere absence of war nor acceptance of non-violence as a strategy. He linked peace with truth achieved through non-violence. Transformation of individual was an essential element of&nbsp;<em>satyagraha.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gandhian Way does not seek to avoid conflict, but seeks to face it squarely.<em>&nbsp;Satyagraha</em>&nbsp;is clearly distinguished from passive resistance.&nbsp;<em>Satyagraha</em>&nbsp;is the weapon of the strong, one who is capable of self- suffering can use it. That strength can come only by following the path of truth with non-violence as is emphasized in<em>satyagraha.</em>&nbsp;'He who has not overcome all fear cannot practice<em>&nbsp;ahimsa</em>&nbsp;to perfection.1&nbsp;Just as love, for Gandhi, was the other side of<em>&nbsp;ahimsa,</em>courage for him was the counterpart of self-suffering. He distinguished self-suffering from cowardice. He said: 'Where there is only one choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence.'2&nbsp;Truth plus non-violence plus self-suffering constitute the essence of&nbsp;<em>satyagraha.</em>3</p>
<p><em>Satya</em>&nbsp;is the ruling principle of the universe.<em>&nbsp;Love is the only relation between human beings.&nbsp;</em></p>
