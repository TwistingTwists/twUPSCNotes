<h3># Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)</h3>
<p><span style="color:#9b59b6">Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are run by private actors, a CBDC would be issued and backed by the central bank.</span></p>

Why are central banks worldwide are so interested in digital currencies ? Carnegie India covers the basics nicely in this article. https://carnegieindia.org/2021/04/13/how-will-digital-currencies-change-wallets-pub-84310</p>
<h3>Four major benefits to digital currencies stand out.</h3>
<p>The first is efficiency, as CBDCs could enable low-cost, instantaneous payments. CBDCs could help process transactions and exchanges more quickly, boosting a country’s productivity and technological progress.</p>
<p>The second is financial inclusion. CBDCs could conceivably provide better access to financial services as people may not need to have a bank account to use them. CBDCs can also be used offline without any internet connection. Transactions can be done with various means. These include radio frequency identification (RFID) using cell phones, smartphones, smartwatches, smart cards, tap-and-go technology (which involves physically tapping two devices to process a transaction), and other kinds of wearable technology. This feature could make CBDCs extremely useful for people living in remote areas.</p>
<p>The third benefit of state-managed digital currencies is preventing corruption and illicit activities. CBDCs could allow governments to keep track of every unit of its currency in circulation. If successful, that would reduce money laundering, tax evasion, black market transactions, and embezzlement.</p>
<p>The final benefit relates to monetary policy. CBDCs could be considered programmable money. In theory, central banks would be able to algorithmically adjust the supply of CBDCs based on interest rates and other key macroeconomic indicators. So CBDCs could give central banks direct control of the money supply, thereby making the economy more responsive to changes in interest rates. Patents filed by the People’s Bank of China indicate that the central bank plans to make use of some of these advantages</p>
