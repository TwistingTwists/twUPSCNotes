<p>Question : good governance =&gt; adm shed its statist character.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>statisst charter = rigid bureaucracy + stability of govt + status quoist adm&nbsp; +&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>issues = non responsive to change +&nbsp;</li></ol></li>
<li>Good governance =&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>break monolith of state in policy making and implementation&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>more actors, civil society&nbsp; + NGO</li>
<li>value oriented = PRACTICE =&gt; service delivery at centre&nbsp;</li>
<li>multiple process inform decision making + multiple actor involved&nbsp;</li></ol></li>
<li>market role in public service delivery up&nbsp; (PMJAY - insurance)&nbsp;</li>
<li>focus on democratic decentralisation&nbsp;</li>
<li>incorporated impact of globalisation on governance - CSR etc&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governance in focus, rather than government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>question : Has New Public Management failed in promoting a democratic polity? Analyse in the contexts of individual as a citizen and individual as a customer. (</p>
<p>NPM = “value for money” to citizens as customers&nbsp;</p>
<p>so focus on efficiency + economy in service delivery&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>consequences on democratic polity :&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>price tag on rights&nbsp;</li>
<li>citizen(customer) and state relation = commercial rather than political&nbsp;</li>
<li>may increase inequalities&nbsp;</li>
<li>political bargaining gone&nbsp;</li>
<li>maybe crony capitalism&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so keep social objectives of governance in mind . thus from NPM -&gt; NPG (new public governance)&nbsp;</p>
