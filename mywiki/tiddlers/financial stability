<p>so now, financial stability&nbsp; = system stability + monetary (price stability) + fiscal sustainability + external sector viability&nbsp;</p>
<p>thus, 2008 crisis changed the perception that price stability (MPC goal) led to financial stability. price alone cannot ensure financial stability</p>
<p>RBI managing financial stress in economic sector = conventional + unconventional measures&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RBI and financial stability during COVID</h3>
<ol>
<li>IMMEDIATE impact = loan moratorium to improve working capital&nbsp;</li>
<li>liquidity augment = easy monetary policy (115 basis point rate cut) + LTRO, TLTRO +&nbsp;</li>
<li>countercyclical measures = relaxation in (regulatory compliance + CCB + group exposure norms)</li>
<li>flow of credit improve = CRR exemption for MSME and retail loan + weight rationalisation for retail&nbsp; + allow banks to count PSL for on-lending by NBFC</li>
<li>proactive risk management and capital raising</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First line of defence in financial stability = effective risk mgmt&nbsp; ( include early warning + forward stress testing framework + use tech = SupTech and RegTech )&nbsp;</p>
<p>resilience in financial system = [[bank re-capitalisation]] + asset quality prediction&nbsp;</p>
<p>why improve supervisory framework of RBI? = financial stability + depositor interest + tech +&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>external sector = why imp for financial stability ? (2008 crisis + 2013 taper tantrum crisis)&nbsp;</p>
<p>measure how? = forex + capital flow + exchange rate + CAD + external debt&nbsp;</p>
<p>Benefits of sound external sector = global spill over no + investor sentiment&nbsp;</p>
