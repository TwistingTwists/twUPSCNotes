<p>Chile - Protest for new constitution to be framed by elected constituent assembly.</p>
<p>Why? - Structural Inequality, earlier constitution had given private rights on natural resources, including Li and Water.</p>
<p>This led to income increase ALONG with inequality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Constitution duly recognises the context of climate emergency and right of people to conserve and benefit from natural resources.</p>
