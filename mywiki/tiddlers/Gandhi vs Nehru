<li>Introduction-&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>There are broadly speaking three dimensions to this relationship.
<ul>
<li>First, it <strong>followed the classical Hegelian pattern </strong>in which a thesis encountered an anti-thesis and the two culminated into the synthesis.</li>
<li>Secondly, through a <strong>process of criticism and mutual correction</strong>, they were able to restrain each other and, in the process, shape each other’s political universe.</li>
<li>Thirdly, cumulatively and together, the two <strong>transformed the struggle</strong> for independence&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<li><u>Conclusion</u>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They together transformed India’s struggle for freedom and played their part in creating a blueprint for the future of India.</p></li>
<li>
<p>All this could become possible because the two understood each other very well and their insights about each other carried deep and profound social and psychological dimensions.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps it would be true to say that nobody else in politics understood Nehru better than Gandhi did. And certainly nobody else understood Gandhi as well as Nehru did.</p></li></ul></li></ul>
