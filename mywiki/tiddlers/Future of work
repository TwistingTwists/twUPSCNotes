<p>"Without employment providing a STRUCTURE in people’s lives and with technology replacing many human activities, our societies will likely shift towards more INDIVIDUALISTIC entities with less human interaction."</p>

<p>"The global labour market was already going through radical changes over the last few decades due to two main factors: (i) the process of INDU­STRIAL RELOCATION in Western countries, and (ii) the so-called TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. So, the real need right now is to evaluate how the&nbsp;COVID-19 crisis&nbsp;will ­affect this ongoing transformation."</p>

<p>"The United States (US) is the great paradigm behind the ongoing TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the mid-20th century, the states located in the centre of the country (also known as “flyover states”) based their economies on manufacturing tangible assets. In 1950, around 35% of Americans were working in the manufacturing sector, while in some of the “flyover states,” this rate was over 50% (Kozmetsky and Yue 2005). In the last 30 years, most of the American manufacturing industry have been outsourced to developing countries with more reduced costs, low labour protection, and minimal environmental regulations, among other advantages. Consequently, the services sector has come to dominate most of the national economy, accounting for 80% of the employment and 77% of the national gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 (World Bank 2019). From a geographical perspective, it has led to the agglomeration of people in cities and the reinforcement of URBAN ECONOMIES. Cities concentrate most of the job opportunities and, consequently, people tend to MIGRATE there. It also explains the increasing spatial ­polarisation between urban and rural areas in the&nbsp;US, although the same dynamics were replicated in the entire Western world."</p>
