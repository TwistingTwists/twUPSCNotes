	<td>
	<p>In coelectrolysis, you bring carbon dioxide into the equation and produce ‘syngas’, which is nothing but a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.<br />
	<br />
	co­electrolysis, which needs heat, is possible only with solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) technology and not others such as polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM).</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Fischer­Tropsch process for making various hydrocarbons from syngas&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p>carbon dioxide produced by burning bagasse need not enter the atmosphere — it can be used for co­electrolysis.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>An SOEC, which produces hydrogen from electricity, is the inverse of an SOFC, which produces electricity from hydrogen.</p>
