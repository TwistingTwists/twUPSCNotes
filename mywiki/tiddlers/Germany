<p>he<em><strong> Weimar Republic</strong></em> was Germany’s government from <strong>1919 to 1933</strong>, the period after World War I until the rise of Nazi Germany. It was named after the town of Weimar where Germany’s new government was formed by a national assembly after Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1932, the Nazi Party became the largest political party in Parliament. After a brief struggle for power, Hitler was named Chancellor in January 1933. Within weeks, he invoked Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution to quash many civil rights and suppress members of the Communist party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 1933, Hitler introduced<u><em><strong> the Enabling Act</strong></em></u> to allow him to pass laws without the approval of Germany’s Parliament or President. To make sure the Enabling Act was passed, Hitler forcibly prevented Communist Parliament members from voting. Once it became law, Hitler was free to legislate as he saw fit and establish his dictatorship without any checks and balances.</p>
