<p>. Biodiversity and climate mitigation and adaptation</p>
<p>‘Nature-based solutions’ often focus on the extent of ecosystems and habitats, but the conservation of species and genetic diversity is important for mitigation and adaptation:</p>
<p>ɠ Plant species diversity, including tree diversity in forests, enhances productivity and carbon storage by terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
<p>ɠ Animals also make substantial contributions to ecosystem carbon sequestration through seed dispersal and trophic interactions such as herbivory or predation in forests.</p>
<p>ɠ In the oceans, whales play an important role in supporting phytoplankton production through fertilization and in carbon sequestration.</p>
<p>ɠ Genetic diversity of both plant and animal species is also important for ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>ɠ The conservation and restoration of genetic and species diversity in crops, livestock and trees can make major contributions to climate adaptation strategies.</p>
