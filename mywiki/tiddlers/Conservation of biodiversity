<p><strong>Why conserve?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Stability of the ecosystem</li>
<li>Biotic = food web</li>
<li>abiotic = habitat,&nbsp;</li>
<li>Key health indicator of system</li></ol>
<p><strong>Pressures on Bio diversity= DIRECT + INDIRECT&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>DIRECT = deforest - climate change - invasive alien species (IAS :p)&nbsp; -&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is conservation helpful?&nbsp; = </strong>GBO-5 says w/o conservation 4x more extinction -&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vision 2050 for biodiversity conservation </strong>= local community empowered conservation + climate change adapt via 'NBS = nature based solutions'&nbsp;+ unsustainable consumption + IAS pressure reduce (pls)&nbsp;</p>
