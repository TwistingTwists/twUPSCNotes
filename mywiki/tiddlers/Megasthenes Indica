<p><strong>Megasthenes’s&nbsp;work, Indika</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Megasthenes&nbsp;describes India as a quadrilateral, with seas on both sides, many large rivers and huge mountains — a very accurate description of our country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Greeks were particularly interested in geography: it seems that the most republished part of Indika is where&nbsp;Megasthenes&nbsp;talks of India’s location, dimensions and topography.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>On food he writes that India grows a lot of millet (bajra), and that it has two crops and a monsoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>He believes India to be the place from where Dionysus and Hercules came, referring to Mount Meru as the place where the former rests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Megasthenes&nbsp;encounters lions, tigers, rhinos and pythons, none of which would have been seen in Europe, but also speaks of flying serpents and winged scorpions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Megasthenes&nbsp;says Indians were divided into seven castes, with Brahmins, the smallest in number, being engaged by others to perform sacrifices, and Kshatriyas, among others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>But he doesn’t have a word for the Vaish, probably because the economy didn’t have much trade or banking at the time (he says that lending was unknown in India).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>He divides the rest of the castes into peasants, herdsmen, artisans, administrators and&nbsp;councillors. The justice system had no jail but amputation of limb or death.&nbsp;</li>
<li>He says, Indians are simple and frugal, though they like ornaments. Their food is a rice pottage.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Indians dislike mobs and consequently they observe good order.&nbsp;</li></ul>
