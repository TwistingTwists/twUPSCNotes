<p><span style="font-size:20px"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Urea, a form of fertiliser is used as a source of nitrogen for plant growth and development. Nitrogen is the key constituent of amino acids, enzymes, DNA and RNA and chlorophyll in a plant. Typically, the nitrogen content in a healthy plant ranges from 1.5-4 per cent. Since nano nitrogen particles are dispersed in liquid form in nano urea, they start acting almost immediately when sprayed on crop leaves to meet the crop nutritional requirement and also trigger pathways for uptake and assimilation of nitrogen.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20px"><span style="font-family:Calibri">All India trials, on nearly 40 crops at more than 11,000 locations, showed nano urea increases crop productivity by eight per cent (in fruits and vegetables the gains were as high as 24 per cent) and can reduce the need for conventional urea by half. Further, application of nano urea improves biomass, soil health and nutritional quality of the produce.</span></span></p>
