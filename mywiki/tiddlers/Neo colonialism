<h3>Colonialism and Neo-colonialism differ on the following aspects:</h3>
<p>• Colonialism involves direct physical or territorial control over the colonies. However, neocolonialism is a policy to maintain developed countries’ indirect influence on developing countries.</p>
<p>• Colonialism which started in the 19 th century, ended in the 20th. However, Neo-colonialism is still in practice, usually by former European colonies in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>• While colonialism used military forces to subjugate other countries, Neo-colonialism uses forces of globalisation.</p>
<p>• Colonialism was the primary stage of Imperialism while neocolonialism is the highest stage of imperialism.</p>
<p>• Under Colonialism, the colonizer country takes over political control, while under Neocolonialism, the country enforces its own laws, but its economy is still controlled by outsiders for their benefit through multinational companies. Under Neo-colonialism, a country may be politically independent and sovereign, but it is economically dependent on other countries<br />
