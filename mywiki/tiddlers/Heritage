<p><strong>What i</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>&nbsp;i</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not naturally given but what humans imagine and construct. What we call ‘heritage’ is not everything we happen to inherit from our ancestors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>It necessarily involves a selection of what we presently consider significant in this inheritance. Every society decides what is and isn’t heritage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The construction of heritage too is deeply political, a field of power not among ruling elites alone but all people whose concern it is.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>It contributes to and enhances our collective self-understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>It&nbsp;affirms our collective identity, is a source of pride.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>It&nbsp;is that part of history which is continuously brought to life by artefacts, integrated with our lived collective experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is a part of the past that we live and with which we live.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>It directly touches&nbsp;identity,&nbsp;it evokes strong feelings.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>It&nbsp;is saturated with ethical evaluation, a judgment of what is worth remembering and preserving.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><strong>Heritage is a way of addressing and rectifying past wrongs</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Raj&nbsp;Ghat&nbsp;is not only a place where we remember Gandhi but also where we mourn his assassination by one of his own countrymen.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Holocaust memorial in Berlin.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Washington’s Vietnam memorial are both gestures towards reparation, monuments of public apology.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><strong>Issues</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Heritage is often linked to cultural domination that invites resistance.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Heritage is that which brings comfort or unease, to which people are either attracted or repulsed</li></ul>
