UTs = not uniformity in their administrative structure. e.g. Delhi Puducherry and JnK&nbsp;<br />
Delhi = NCT</p>
<h3>HISTORY&nbsp;</h3>
<p><br />

2. Until 1993 Delhi is UTs w/o legislature<br />
3. Balakrishnan Report (1987) = Delhi belongs to nation as a whole but it is also inhabited by its own people. Not recommend statehood to Delhi.&nbsp;<br />

<p>NCT of Delhi amendment act, 2021 : provisions&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Analysis #mains</h3>
<p><br />
1. Streamline the relationship between Delhi govt and LG&nbsp;<br />
2. It is not against democratically elected govt of Delhi<br />
3. Strengthens role of Central govt in administration of NCT &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Delhi HC, 2016 ruling</h3>
<p><br />
Complete control of <strong>all matters </strong>is with LG. No decision can be taken by CoM without concurrence of LG</p>
<h3>SC, 2018</h3>
<ol>
<li>Pragmatic and collaborative federalism will fall to the ground if Union has overiding executive powers even over matters where delhi legislative assembly has powers too.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Concurrence of LG needed by CoM on <strong>substantive issues&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>LG is <strong>facilitator </strong>not adversary with hostile attitude towards Delhi govt.</li></ol>
