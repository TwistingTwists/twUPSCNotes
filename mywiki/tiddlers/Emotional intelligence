<h3>Cultivating EI&nbsp;</h3>
<ol>
<li>Emotions = patience (painting and cooking - can't haste these), irritation (dance heart out, quick walk), role of parents, exposure</li>
<li>Role of religion - gita (quote about karma and do not worry about results)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Leaders = freedom fighters (sacrficie and personal hardships)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Philosophies = anger - Buddhism anger is like grasping hot coal which is going to burn your hand first.</li>
<li>Parents = experience and trust on oneself that despite all despair, there is hope&nbsp;</li>
<li>Exposure = to child orphanage and environment zoo = develop env ethics and compassion towards weaker sections of society.&nbsp;</li></ol>
