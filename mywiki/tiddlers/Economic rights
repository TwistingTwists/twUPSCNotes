<p><strong>household work </strong>= includes cooking and cleaning , fetching water and firewood ,&nbsp; taking care of children and the elderly.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.forumias.com/getting-serious-about-supporting-the-care-economy/">ILO new</a> report -&nbsp;</p>
<h3>DATA&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>NSSO time use survey 2019</h4>

<ol>
<li>NSSO - decision to estimate unpaid work&nbsp;</li>
<li>Kamal hasan party (&nbsp;“Makkal Needhi Maiam”) = value unpaid work&nbsp;</li>

<h3>Reasons&nbsp;</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cultural
<ol>
<li>HOUSE is the <em><strong>rightful and natural context</strong></em> for women , women as family honor and 'keep in bounds of house'</li>
<li>stunts men into pre-fabricated social roles + confined women to supportive secondary roles.</li>
<li>Dual burden on women.</li></ol></li>
<li>Religious , historical&nbsp;</li>
<li>Economic = low FLFPR + wage gap (1/5 of men as per Global Gender gap report, WEF) +&nbsp;</li>
<li>Industrial revolution = men goto work in factory , women stay at home.</li></ol>
<h3>way forward&nbsp;</h3>
<ol>
<li>Social protection policies like UBI</li>
<li>Concept of time bank for women&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="color:#e74c3c">Social lens change = shared reponsibility in household</span></li>
<li>concept of public services + infrastructure&nbsp;</li>
<li>GDP accounting +&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li></ol>
<h3>Conclusion&nbsp;</h3>
<ol>
<li>SC, 2020 (<strong>Arun Kumar Agarwal vs National insurance company )</strong> : also observed that it cannot be computed in terms of money. Her services rendered with <span style="color:#3498db"><em>true love and affection </em></span>cannot be equated with services rendered by others.</li>
<li>The unpaid work is not recognised by the society nor the government.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In the end, no woman escapes pressure of cooker.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Employment&nbsp; - FLFPR</h2>
<h3>increase how?&nbsp;</h3>
<ol>
<li>Child care (creche) {maternity benefit amendment, 4 visits/day) + Centre like "sangini" of SEWA which provides full day care.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Lower income tax on female income.</li>
<li>Digital divide&nbsp;</li>
<li>Gender sensitive data collection : UN women initiative&nbsp;" making every women and girl count" was launched in 2016 to prioritise the data.</li>
<li>Return to career schemes for women.</li></ol>
<h2>Menstrual leave&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>issues&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
<li>hiring of certain age bracket + gendering workplace + patriarchial attitude enforce + Women not good as men?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Larger Challenges that should be addressed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Destigmatising menstruation</li>
<li>Diversity at the workplace</li>
<li>Access to sanitary pads or menstrual cups,</li>
<li>Why religious orthodoxy looks at menstruation as impure,</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion&nbsp;</h3>
<p>There needs to be a paradigm shift from Beti bachao, Beti Padhao, to <strong>Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Beti kamao&nbsp;</strong>to ensure economic rights are duly given.</p>
