<h1>CASTE IDENTITY</h1>
<h3>Presnce of caste&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
<li>in India, sanitation work is caste-ridden and hence, there is an urgent need to dissociate caste from labour. Manual scavenger</li></ul>
<h3>impact on politics&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
<li>material and civic issues of everyday life get subdued by identity politics around caste. [Like in Bihar]</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Institutionalisation of caste</h3>
<ol>
<li>Political :&nbsp; Parties on caste lines.</li>
<li>Social : invisibility of caste in urban landscape</li>
<li>Administrative : SECC, 2011</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reduce caste based discrimination</h3>
<ol>
<li>CoI provisions - Affirmative action&nbsp;</li>
<li>True assessment of the backwardness of various castes. = subcategorisation of caste</li>
<li>Education - NEP = special education zones.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>However, progress towards a equality as constitutional value ought to remain the stateâ€™s ultimate goal.</p>
<h3>Conclusion&nbsp;</h3>
<p>caste is emerging as stand alone socio-political identity.</p>

<h1>CASTE AND URBAN SPACES - modern caste</h1>
<h3><strong>Forms of modern casteism in urban spaces</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Preferentially NOT choosing Dalit Doctor for treatment.</li>
<li>Asking for the marks of Dalit students publicly to humiliate them,</li>
<li>Making a mockery of their English and physical appearance,</li>
<li>Stigmatising them as inefficient,</li>
<li>Not acting on incidents of caste-based harassment and abuses,</li>
<li>Not providing a support system, or reducing or stopping their fellowships</li></ul>
<h3>Impact&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Such discriminations dilute the small progress made by Dalits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How to counter?&nbsp;</h3>
<ol>
<li>Bridge courses to ensure that there is no learning gap and mainstreaming is smooth.</li>
<li>Local reservation in jobs = Affirmative action in hiring might improve economic performance.</li></ol>
<p>In news : Maratha reservation</p>
<h3>Conclusion&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Move beyond the tokenism of having one Dalit chief justice or two Dalit presidents, and ensure adequate representation to its Dalit and Adivasi citizens in all fields.</p>
