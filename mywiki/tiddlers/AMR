<p>AMR as silent Tsunami which has potential to reverse the gains in medical science.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>India</h3>
<p>Largest producer and consumer of antibiotics. Lancet : AMR is leading cause of death across world. India as "epicentre" of AMR</p>
<h3>Causes&nbsp;</h3>
<ol>
<li>anti biotic usage in animals for growth e.g. Colistin in poultry&nbsp;</li>
<li>hospital spread = nocosomical infections&nbsp;</li>
<li>reckless use of anti biotics e.g. self treating with antibiotics + leaving treatment mid-way</li>
<li>Pollution by Pharmaceutical industry</li>
<li>Cultural activities - mass bathing in rivers -&gt; more prone to&nbsp;AMR bacteria</li></ol>
<h3>GoI Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>red line campaign&nbsp; + H1 drug category&nbsp;</li>
<li>chennai declaration&nbsp;</li>
<li>NAP -AMR 2017-2021&nbsp;</li>
<li>NCDC as national surveillance body&nbsp;</li></ol>
<h3>way forward&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Cause = animal + hospital + indiscriminate use of anti-biotics&nbsp;</p>
<p>during spread = Surveillance measures (NCDC)&nbsp;</p>
<h3>BY WHO</h3>
<ol>
<li>preparation to prevent = better anti biotics (no new anti biotics in past 3 decades)</li>
<li>&nbsp;1bn $ AMR research fund by WHO&nbsp;</li>
<li>GLASS by WHO&nbsp; - surveillance&nbsp;</li>
<li>AWaRE&nbsp; - Access , Watch , Reserve</li></ol>
<p>ONE health approach</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Abbv:</h3>
<p>NCDC = national centre for disease control&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAP-AMR = national action plan on AMR</p>
