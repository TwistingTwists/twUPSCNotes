<p>insolvency and bankruptcy code = form of alternate dispute resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>two principles&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Accountability&nbsp;</li>
<li>efficient use of capital = if company cannot conitnue =&gt; shut down. or REORGANISE assets for efficiency.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>in case of backdoor-entry, 1. is violated 2. is followed. So, it allows promoters of company to retain ownership by getting rid of pesky creditors.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
hence, SC rightly upheld 1. &gt; 2. i.e. accountability is more important.&nbsp;</p>
