<p>India will emerge as the third-largest NG consumer behind US and China by 2030</p>
<p>IEAâ€™s India energy Outlook&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gas-based economy 6 to 15% by 2030</p>
<p>Pipeline length to be doubled over next few years to exceed 32,000 km</p>
<p>60 billion investment in one nation one gas grid</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Policy initiatives- Open access to pipeline network , gas exchange , marketing reforms and governments commitment to move towards cleaner fuels</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boost adoption of natural gas,&nbsp; Three critical steps</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Natural gas marketing reforms + launch of gas exchange - enable uniformity in price discovery, accurate demand forecasting,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- gas now, is under administered price regime</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- gas market is. Bifurcated by two moving parts: one which has prices and quantities set by the Indian government, and another which utilises gas at market (LNG import) prices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- gas is not under GST and hence faces the cascading effect of taxes thus disincentivising consumption</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. OALP - exploration</p>
<p>3. Low Capacity utilisation of gas plants, not cost competitive</p>
<p>- Parliamentary standing committee on energy - 14.3 GW of stranded gas-based plants</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Way forward</p>
<p>Reduce the import of LNG which is Fossil based</p>
<p>Towards cleaner gas fuels like biogas and electrolytic hydrogen</p>
