40 mha of the country is flood prone.

!! Issues
# ensemble forecast vs deterministic forecast 
Early time a week vs 24 hours. 


# multiple agencies for forcast - rainfall forecast then flood forecast 
Cwc integrated data from IMD rain fall warning 
Early warning forecast needed 
IMD (Doppler radars ) , CWC tech obsolete :(
