<h3>HISTORY of census</h3>
<p>The earliest literature 'Rig-Veda'&nbsp; &nbsp;population count was maintained in during 800-600 BC in India.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Arthashastr' by 'Kautilya' written in the 3rd Century BC prescribed the collection of population statistics as a measure of state policy for taxation. It contained a detailed description of methods of conducting population, economic and agricultural censuses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Akbar, ‘Ain-e-Akbari' included comprehensive data pertaining to population, industry, wealth and many other characteristics.</p>
<p>A systematic and modern population census, in its present form was conducted <strong><em>non synchronously</em></strong> between 1865 and 1872 in different parts of the country. This effort culminating in 1872 has been popularly labeled as the first population census of India However, the first synchronous census in India was held in 1881. Since then, censuses have been undertaken uninterruptedly once every ten year.</p>

<h3>RELEVANCE of census 2011</h3>
<p>&nbsp;Census 2001 has been exceptional in more than one way. The foremost thing about this census has been that all tabulations are based on 100% count which is unlike previous censuses when sampling was resorted to. The use of intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) technology has made it possible. Besides this is first census of the 21st century and the new millennium. Therefore, Census 2001 results will become the benchmark for future censuses. The data on economic indicators and, in particular, the structure of the workforce shall help in measuring the effect of the structural changes taking place in the economy since its deregularization and decontrol.</p>
<p>Census data is also used for demarcation of constituencies and allocation of representation to parliament, State legislative Assemblies and the local bodies.&nbsp;</p>
