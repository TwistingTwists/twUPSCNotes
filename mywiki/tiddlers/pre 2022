<p>. B cells, for example, would churn out antibodies — including a particularly potent disease-fighter called IgG — to roam the body in search of the virus. Other cells, called T cells, would either help B cells produce antibodies or seek out and destroy the infected cells.</p>

<p>vaccines that are injected through the nose or mouth would also tap into another set of immune cells that hang around mucosal tissues. The B cells that reside there can make another type of antibody, called IgA, that plays a large role in destroying the airway pathogens. In addition to this, the T cells that are residing nearby will be able to memorise the pathogens that it encountered and will lifelong scout the areas where these were first encountered</p>
