	<td>MMR</td>
	<td>113 (2018)&nbsp; , 80% reduction since 1990<br />
	&nbsp;
	<p>MMR has fallen<br />
	400 in 2000-2001 to 97 (2018-20)<br />
	<br />
	India's MMR stands at half of global MMR (221 in 2017).</p>
	<p>Challenges<br />
	However, variation of MMR at state level still remains a concern. For ex MMR in Assam, Madhya Pradesh &amp; Uttar Pradesh is still higher than 150.<br />
	Rate of decline in MMR has not been uniform across the country. West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh &amp; Haryana have slower rate of decline of MMR.</p>
	<p>Reasons for decline:<br />
	Larger of proportion of births are happening in institutional set up.<br />
	Increasing age of marriage and first pregnancy.<br />
	Greater focus on women education.<br />
	Birth spacing between children.</p></td>
