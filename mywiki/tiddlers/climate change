<li>emissions gap report 2020 (EGR), india will overperform its INDC by 15%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>collective ambition of NDCs must increase 5x to deliver 1.5 deg C Paris Climate goal.&nbsp;</li>
<li>top 4 {USA(26%), China (13%), EU(22), India (3%) } emit 55% of GHG emissions. = climate inequality Hence CBDR-RC</li></ol>
<p>WMO state of global climate report 2019&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>T = 1.1deg C up</li>
<li>CO2 = 1.5x since pre industrial levels</li>
<li>Ocean acidification = 23% up in last decade.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Sea levels are rising.
<ul>
<li>Sea level continues to rise at a rate of about one-eighth of an inch per year.</li>
<li>In 2014, global sea level was 2.6 inches above the 1993 average—the highest annual average in the satellite record (1993-present).</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3>progress made by india&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
<li>reduced emission intensity by 21% by 2005 levels</li>
<li>EGR, 2020 (UNEP) =&nbsp;India’s per capita emissions are actually<strong>&nbsp;60% lower than the global average</strong></li>
<li>ISA + CDRI</li>
<li>Solar target INCREASED&nbsp; to 450GW + BS VI + National Solar-wind hybrid policy + One sun One world One Grid +&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h3>way forward&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Green recovery</p>
<p>climate action plan = CBRD-RC + as per national circumstances</p>
<h3>example&nbsp;</h3>
<ol>
<li>Climate change has added over 1,000 lakes in Swiss Alps: study</li>
<li>Madagascar = first climate induced famine due to temperate rise and water shortage</li>
<li>Pan Africa water crisis - no water + As Fluoride contamination.</li>
<li>
<p>Sportsmanship - <span style="color:#f1c40f">beijing olympics</span> - <strong>artificial snow</strong>&nbsp; = GW used + energy fossil based (envt)&nbsp; = Environmental ethics</p></li>
